## AI Reflection

AI helped me for the most part with just coming up with the framework and bare bones for the website. I was able to prompt it using the instructions on what I wanted on each page. This made this assignment much smoother as I had the base html and css in place and could modify things as I saw fit vs having to take the time to create all the code on my own. 

AI didn't make a ton of mistakes as the html and css for this was fairly straight forward. I would say it would occasionally add features or details that were not needed. A couple of times it ventured outside of the instructions and created something that I did not need. 

I balanced the AI assitance with my own coding by using the AI to generate the base html and css pages. Then was able to use that as a base and personalize the website. It made it a lot easier to work off of something then have to create the html skeleton and additonal pages manually. It let me cut through the mundane html layouts and get right to getting my information on the website/customizing with css.
